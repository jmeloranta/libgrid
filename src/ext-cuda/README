Why are these files here? The don't seem to belong to libgrid?

In order to make operations that apply a user defined function on
a grid with CUDA, one must have the corresponding CUDA kernel for them.
Two possibilities to do this:

1) Have the application do this CUDA programming (not clean as libgrid is
supposed to hide all this).

2) Embed these functions to libgrid (this is why these functions are here).

To add a new function, number the files in sequence and follow the examples
in the files. Also, add the new ext files to the make file (../Makefile).
