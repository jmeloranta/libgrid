CUDA and openmp aware routines for Cartesian 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D grids. Note that the former two are obtained as a special case
of 3D with the first two dimensions set to one (explicit 1-D and 2-D rotunes have been removed).

Review make.conf for correct compilation parameters. Go to src/ and say make & make install (the latter probably as root).

Needs: fftw and optionally lapack/blas and CUDA.
