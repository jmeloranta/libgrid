- try using local memory for derivatives etc. (avooid jumping in memory)
- large memory cuda: something's not right with memory transfers - excessive?
- CUDA: Does CN with absorbing boundaries work correctly??
- Grid: 512 x 343 x 343 does not seem to work. Problem with mapping the potential? Propagation leads to exapnsion of the bubble.
- Still sometimes eating all CPU (800% !, 100% would be OK) while everything should be running on GPU?! It seems to have openmp
  busy wait threads as well as cuda initiated threads.
- grid_wf_nornmalize2(gwf, REAL, INT, INT, INT): nornmalize value of |gwf->value[i.j.k]|^2 to REAL
  write CUDA version so that driver.c scale_wf does not have to fetch data from GPU
- CUDA Poisson solver

- profiling normal & cuda.

- Check that HD, thermal, and HD BF terms work (from libdft)
X multi GPU support (at least be able to select GPU). Can we use streams?

also fgrep TODO *.[ch] to find out more specific issues.
